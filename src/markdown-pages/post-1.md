Starting my website and blog from the very basics again: this site is just using
GatsbyJS, sourced from Markdown files, hosted on GitHub pages. No frills for
now, really just wanted to focus on getting it out!

Now I have no excuse, publishing a blog post is as easy as creating a Markdown
file and running `npm run deploy`...
